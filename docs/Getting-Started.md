# Getting Started

Bizongo Integration Gateway allows developers to build system-to-system hookpoints and flows, if your organisation is a valid customer of Bizongo.

Every Bizongo customer can setup a custom integration to allow for completely autonomous ordering flows, if they already have a system for placing orders to Bizongo.

Bizongo accepts purchase orders, and delivery schedules on a qualified list of products. Once the order is successfully placed, the APIs will also allow you to track status of each order, along with shipment statuses if the order is enroute.
